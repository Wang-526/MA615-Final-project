# Introduction of my Final project 
My project is modified based on another group project of mine. My classmate Hao Shen has already applied to Havilian to use that project as the basis to complete our MA615 final project.

My shiny app has been handed over to bu-rstudio-connect, you can see my final results on it. It should be admitted that since the database we use on shiny is several GB in size, you may have to wait a little while loading. The Link is: https://bu-rstudio-connect.bu.edu/content/41/

The name of my report is: 615-final-project.html
Because the pictures I draw are basically dynamic and interactive, I use HTML files as reports. In order to prevent the HTML file from opening, I converted the HTML to the PDF version as a backup. But there are some problems with typesetting. So, please include my HTML file as my final report.

Compared to an analysis report, my final project is more like a simple app. On this project, I tried as much as possible what Haviland taught me this semester.
